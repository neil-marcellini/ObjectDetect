# ObjectDetect
Object Detect is an app that uses CoreML and the Resnet50 model to identify objects through the camera. I followed [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/p6GA8ODlnX0) to get the camera set up 
and to use the CoreML model. I then added labels to show the observation and its associated confidence.

## Getting Started
You will need to download the Resnet50.mlmodel file and drag it into Xcode, as it was too large to commit to git. Make sure to run it on a real device to see the camera.

## What I Learned
I had a lot of fun with this short project! It is amazing how easy it is to use a CoreML model, and to pass it images from the camera. I also got some experience with programmatic UI through UIkit.
